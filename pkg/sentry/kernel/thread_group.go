// A ThreadGroup is a logical grouping of tasks that has widespread

	// signalHandlers is the set of signal handlers used by every task in this
	// thread group. (signalHandlers may also be shared with other thread
	// groups.)

	// signalHandlers.mu (hereafter "the signal mutex") protects state related
	// to signal handling, as well as state that usually needs to be atomic
	// with signal handling, for all ThreadGroups and Tasks using
	// signalHandlers. (This is analogous to Linux's use of struct
	// sighand_struct::siglock.)

	// The signalHandlers pointer can only be mutated during an execve
	// (Task.finishExec). Consequently, when it's possible for a task in the
	// thread group to be completing an execve, signalHandlers is protected by
	// the owning TaskSet.mu. Otherwise, it is possible to read the
	// signalHandlers pointer without synchronization. In particular,
	// completing an execve requires that all other tasks in the thread group
	// have exited, so task goroutines do not need the owning TaskSet.mu to
	// read the signalHandlers pointer of their thread groups.
